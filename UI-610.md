# [UI-610] ONC UIUX: Create right side bar & functionality

## User Story

Create right side bar that persists regardless of what other buttons/pages the questionnaire is on.

## Acceptance

- [x] As a user entering oncology data in a UR questionnaire, I will see a persistent side bar on the right hand side of the page regardless of what side pane tab or section I am on.
- [ ] I will see 8-10 lines of text within the right side bar fields, and then be forced to scroll if there is more text than that.
- [ ] I can expand or collapse like an accordion the fields visible in the right side bar. By default, they are always collapsed so only the field name displays.
- [ ] The fields are editable on the right side bar.
- [ ] This will not be implemented across all registries, only the Oncology registry questionnaire, always.

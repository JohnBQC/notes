# UI-860

## Path

- Will need to update useSources to give me valid sources (yikes).
  - Opportunity to smooth out handleSourceChange as well (imagine we use this a lot)
- Will Need to update EditGrid to handle all possible fields/props as listed below.
  - It may be a good place to isolate the shared tile props and separate that to it's own set of inputs.
  - Would need to start in EditTile and move title and index, likely into it's own new component
  - Already tried refactoring EditTile/hooks, shouldn't be breaking*TM*

## GridProps

all can be null

- alternateRendering
- apllicableFilters
- calculateFooterLocally
- fields
- filters
- footerEnabled
- groupBy
- hasSummaryPrefix
- initialFilters
- legendPosition
- legendText
- showGridActions
- source
- summaryField
- summarySource
- summaryText
- summaryType
- summaryVisible
- upgroupedData

## TileProps

- customClass
- maxHeight
- maxWidth
- showActions
- showBorders
- showHeader - can not be null
- subTitle
- title - can not be null
- visibleField
- visibleType
- visibleValue

## StableProps

- !columnId!
- !id!
- !index!
- !key!
- !type!
- !updatedAt!

GridFilter is not saving, data is coming in correctly up through the grid, but save_object breaks. Take more stuff over from fields so that it works

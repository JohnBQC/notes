  - [x] Based on my permissions to the Registry Maintenance Page, I will or will not see those tabs
    - If I have ‘Modify Registry Settings’ I can access the export, extract, provider, and hospital mgmt tabs
    - If I have ‘Update Facility Detail in Registry Tool’ I can access the ‘Maintenance’ tab
    - If I have ‘Import Registry Data' I can access the import tab
    - Non-Oncology registries display the current designs, and are un-impacted by this change.
    - Export, extract, import, maintenance, providers, and hospitals all behave as expected.

# [UI-708] Create Case Finding Container

Creates components to render Container rows in the CaseFinding Table/Tab.
Rows are accordions containing sub-rows addressed in a later ticket.

If a Container has no sub-rows the accordion indicator will show open but be disabled.
If there is an ICD10 code match, default to expanded.
Show ~3.5 sub-rows so they'e noticably scrollable (confirmed in later ticket)

- [ ] Create a real Row in the mocks
- [ ] Create Container component (hoping colSpan makes life easier)
- [ ] Stub out Static Headers (Reportable button, Add Primary and Select functionality)
